Contents of this package:
  module - Contains source code of as6712 kernel driver modules.
  util   - operational scripts.

Sonic creates a docker container and run building process under it.
If user tries to built new drivers, please get into that docker and 
dpkg-buildpackage for them.

All Linux kernel code is licensed under the GPLv1. All other code is
licensed under the GPLv3. Please see the LICENSE file for copies of
both licenses.

The code for integacting with Accton AS6712-32X has 2 parts, 
kernel drivers and operational script. 
The kernel drivers of peripherals are under module/ directory.
1.  These drivers can be built to individual ko during dpkg-buildpackage.
2.  A operational script, accton_as6712_util.py, for device initializatian.
    Run "accton_as6712_util.py install" to install drivers.

To initialize the system, run "accton_as6712_util.py install".
To clean up the drivers & devices, run "accton_as6712_util.py clean".
To dump information of sensors, run "accton_as6712_util.py show".
To dump SFP EEPROM, run "accton_as6712_util.py sff".
To set fan speed, run "accton_as6712_util.py set fan".
To enable/disable SFP emission, run "accton_as6712_util.py set sfp".
To set system LEDs' color, run "accton_as6712_util.py set led"
For more information, run "accton_as6712_util.py --help".

====================================================================
Besides applying accton_as6712_util.py to access peripherals, you can 
access peripherals by sysfs nodes directly after the installation is run.

System LED:
    There are 5 system LEDs at the lower-left corner of front panel.
    They are  loc, diag, fan, ps1, and ps2. 
    The sysfs interface color mappings are as follows:
    Brightness:
        0 => off
        1 => green
        2 => amber
        3 => red
        4 => blue
    But not all colors are available for each LED.

Fan Control:
    There are 10 fans inside 5 fan modules.
    All fans share 1 duty setting, ranged from 0~100.

Thermal sensers:
    3 temperature sensors are controlled by the lm75 kernel modules. 

PSUs:
    There 2 power supplies slot at the left/right side of the back.
    Once if a PSU is not plugged, the status of it is shown failed.

There are 32 QSFP modules are equipped. 
Before operating on PSU and QSFP+, please make sure it is well plugged. 
Otherwise, operation is going to fail.
